    <h1>Worldview Designs and Prototypes</h1>
    <p><a href="old-tab-overhaul/index.html#layers_page">Older design of the product picker</a>.  This design includes some ideas for the "unification" of UI elements all to the sidebar. You may have to zoom out for the links to target parts of the image specifically.</p>
    <p><a href="newer-tab-overhaul/index.html#final_view1_layers_page">Updated UI unification idea</a>.  Designed with A/B comparison originally. The design of A/B comparison changed (see below) but moving the "floating toolbar" into the sidebar was always part of my plans.</p>
    <p><a href="ab-comparison-final/index.html#start_page">Final look of A/B Comparison</a>.  Designed with the current look of Worldview in mind, disregarding the migration of the floating toolbar to the sidebar ideas above.</p>
    <p><a href="mockup/product-picker.pdf">Bonus</a>:  Just some old mockups of the product picker with images. Large 60mb pdf...</p>
